- 👋 Hi, I’m @martinwilliamsiet
- 👀 I’m interested in predicting the winners and losers in sporting events, and transforming as many addicts into life winners as possible worldwide by leveraging data tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, ETL workflow enhancement, scraping, end to end app production, translating customer desires into reality!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Modeling, RAG, Research, Python/any coding or other relevant activities to how data can help us prepare for the future, and how data can aid us in preventing and managing addiction.
- 📫 How to reach me - LinkedIn only for now please.
